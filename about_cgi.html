        <h1>What can Python do for us?</h1>
        
        <p>
            First we will serve the contents of this folder using the
            built in <em>http.server</em> module.
        </p>

        <p>To do this use the <code>python -m http.server</code> command.</p>

        <p>
            Now say that we a have list of all students and their ages
            stored in a file in CSV file.
            <br />
            This information can change at any time, we want the current
            information from the file to be displayed in a table
            when a person visits the page.
            <br />
            When the user visits the page, we want Python to read the file for
            us and generate the HTML resopnse.
        </p>

        <p>Have a look at the file <a href="names.txt">here</a>.</p>

        <p>But we can't always just send the user to a text file.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We might want to format the data nicely.</li>
            <li>We might have to query a database for the correct information.</li>
            <li>We may have to look into multiple files to get information for one page.</li>
            <li>
                We may want to do some security checks before sharing information, like
                having a log in system.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            If we start the server with the command
            <code>python -m http.server --cgi</code>,
            the server is configured to look treat the files in the
            <code>cgi-bin/</code> folder as executable CGI Python files.
